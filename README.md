# NexusMind DeSci Lab Architecture

## Overview

NexusMind DeSci Lab is built on a microservices architecture, leveraging blockchain technology and AI to create a decentralized platform for scientific research.

## Components

1. **Frontend**
   - React.js with Next.js for server-side rendering
   - Web3.js for blockchain interactions
   - TensorFlow.js for client-side AI computations

2. **Backend**
   - Node.js with Express for RESTful API
   - MongoDB for data persistence
   - Redis for caching

3. **Blockchain Layer**
   - Ethereum smart contracts (Solidity)
   - IPFS for decentralized storage

4. **AI Layer**
   - TensorFlow for model training and inference
   - Scikit-learn for data preprocessing

5. **Peer Review System**
   - Decentralized consensus mechanism
   - Reputation scoring algorithm

## Data Flow

1. User submits research paper through frontend
2. Backend validates and processes submission
3. Paper is stored on IPFS, with hash recorded on blockchain
4. AI model analyzes paper for plagiarism and quality
5. Peer review process initiated through smart contracts
6. Reviewers submit feedback, stored on blockchain
7. Consensus reached, paper published or rejected

## Security Measures

- End-to-end encryption for data transmission
- Multi-factor authentication for user accounts
- Smart contract audits to ensure blockchain security
- Regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments

## Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal scaling of backend services
- Load balancing across multiple nodes
- Sharding of blockchain data for improved performance
- Caching strategies to reduce database load

This architecture ensures a robust, secure, and scalable platform for decentralized scientific research and collaboration.
